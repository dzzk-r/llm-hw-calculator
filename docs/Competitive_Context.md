# Competitive Context (Architectural Comparison)

The modeling framework supports comparison between:

-   rki / rkc --- Integrated SoC LLM accelerators
-   h8m2 / h10hm2 --- Discrete edge accelerators
-   nvj --- Embedded GPU class
-   nvo --- Datacenter HBM class

The goal is architectural modeling, not marketing benchmarking.
